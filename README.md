Code and data to practice using R for data management


These materials assume you already know how to open R and enter commands in the console.
Start with lesson 02 (beginning with R). You can use the file "with code" as an answer key.

Use `Save As` to make a new copy of the file 02_beginningWithR.Rmd that includes your initials in the filename. Enter your code in that new file and save your work.

When you are done with lesson 02, 
  1. commit your changes (the new file), 
  2. pull the repository again to make sure you are up to date, and 
  3. push your committed changes back to the main repository. 
Remember, to commit you will need to select which files you want to "stage" and type a descriptive message about what is new in this commit.

If you feel comfortable with the work in lesson 02 and the pull/pull/commit process, try lesson 03 as well!

Let me know when you run into issues ---
