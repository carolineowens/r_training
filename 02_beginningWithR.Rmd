```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Lesson plan:
 - write code in the console
 - assign names to objects in R to save them in  the memory of R
 - save code in scripts so we can come back to them later
 - comment script to remember what we did
 - learn how to use R functions to manipulate data in R
 - learn about different kinds of data in R
 - deal with data where some parts are missing
 
 
```{r creating objects}
# CREATING OBJECTS IN R

# R is a calculator! -------------





# Assigning objects ---------------
# Try out the assignment operator:
## Mac 'Option' + '-'
## PC 'Alt' + '-'


# Create an object called weight_kg and assign it the value, 55

# assign the object

# print the object

# assign + print the object


# Run your code outside of the console ---------
## Mac: Command + Enter or Ctrl + Enter
## PC: Ctrl + Enter



# Try commenting this code ---------
# Comment above the line: this is the weight of a dog
# comment to the side: # this particular dog was a large breed





# Calculations with objects ----------

# Let's try some calculations with our object, weight_kg

# convert weight in kg to lbs

# reassign weight

# convert new weight

# create new object with calculation

# reassign weight!


### QUESTION: What do you think that the current value of weight_lb is? ------- 
```



```{r functions and arguments}
# Now we want to try using functions and changing their arguments

# calculate the squareroot of weight_kg using the function sqrt()

# calculate the squareroot of our object, weight_lb



# Functions with multiple arguments ------


#For example, let's look at the round() function, which rounds numbers to different decimal places.

# To find out the arguments for the round() function, we could use the args() function

# change the base arguments of the round() function to 2

# another way to do it:

# yet another way to do it:

```




```{r vectors and data types}
# Create a numeric vector -----

# we can create a vector in R using the c() function
# our vector will be called weight_g
# and will include the values 50, 60, 65, and 82

# What does this vector look like if we print it like we did weight_kg?





# Create a non-numeric vector ------

# let's create a vector of the animals we weighed
# our vector will be called animals
# and will include mouse, rat, and dog

# What does this vector look like?




# The "" are very important for a character vector. Otherwise, R will think that you have created three objects called mouse, rat, and dog, and will spit out an error message because it can't find those objects. 







# Explore vector information ------

# There are a lot of functions in R that let you explore vectors, let's play with a few

# Maybe I want to know how many animals I weighed or observed, which I can find out with
# the length() function


# Using the length() function, how many numbers are in our vector, weight_g



# and in our vector, animals?



# Or, maybe I want to know whether my vector contains numbers (numeric) or words (characters)


# A really useful function for many different kinds of data in R, especially more complex
#ones, is the str() function, which let's you look at the structure of the data


# You can use the c() function to add other elements to your vector:


```


```{r subsetting vectors}

# We can extract values from vectors:
# to do this, we use square brackets []


# create a new vector called animals, with mouse, rat, dog, cat


# what is the number two position of our vector, animals?



# what are the number 3 AND number 2 positions of our vector, animals?


# We can leverage these brackets to create new objects ------- 

# create a new vector called more_animals with a combination of the values from vector, animals

# print it and see what it looks like





# Conditional subsetting: -----

# Another common way to subset is by using logicals
# TRUE will select the element with the same index
# while FALSE will not:



# we want to pull anything that is more than 50

## so we can use this to select only the values above 50


# now print out our new weight_g vector









# We can also COMBINE tests using
# & (both conditions are true, AND) 
# | (at least one of the conditions is true, OR)

# in our vector weight_g subset values greater than 30 AND less than 50

# now subset values less than or equal to 30 OR equal to 55

# now subset values greater than or equal to 30 AND equal to 21





# Searching for values in a vector ------


# return both rat and cat using conditional test


# now try with the %in% function


# use the logical vector created by %in% to return elements from animals
# that are found in the character vector



```







```{r missing data}
# As R was designed to analyze datasets, it includes the concept of missing data (which is uncommon in other programming languages). Missing data are represented in vectors as NA.

# new vector called heights with values, 2, 4, 4, NA, and 6

# try calculating the mean and maximum for this list



# try calculating the mean and maximum for this list with the argument, na.rm = TRUE








# other functions can help you with missing data like:
# is.na()
# na.omit()
# complete.cases()


## Extract those elements which are not missing values from heights

## Returns the object with incomplete cases removed.

## Extract those elements which are complete cases.
